This extension is made specifically for [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/). I have not tested it on any other iterations or flavors of Firefox but theoretically it should work.

### Features

- **Copy tab URL with a simple click of the extension icon**

- **Customizable keyboard shortcut defaulted to Shift+Ctrl+C for familiarity** 
_(Note: Zen recently added this shortcut and it may have other conflicts with other keyboard shortcuts. Please check Zen Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts to ensure there are no conflicts)_

- **Copy the Base URL instead of the full URL with the button in the popup or set the default to copy the base URL**

- **Adds a context menu item when right clicking on other tabs (loaded or unloaded) to copy that tabs URL.** (For some reason this isn't an option in the Base Browser.)

- **Toggle option to put the icon _inside_ the URL bar.** (I prefer it outside on the toolbar but this was requested so I added it). 
_(This is only tested in Zen and only in 'Multiple toolbars' and 'Collapsed toolbar' mode. I haven't tested in 'Single toolbar' mode, and there may be bugs with it right now and Zen Mod 'Super URL Bar'. Your experience may vary.)_
